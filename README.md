 <h2>WHAT IS IT?</h2>
 
Build a static (front-end only) for a online classes. For the purposes of this project, I have chosen to build a website for online Yoga classes. 

<h2>Brief</h2>

- The main target audience are yoga and mindfullness practitioners,  who do not have much time to go to studios or prefer to do the exercises at home.
- This showcase will be used for the purpose of First Time Visitor so that they can receive access to several online classes tailed by responsible professionals.
- Returning and Frequent Visitor users, who can access their exercises and training through the login option from their personal accounts.
- The following assets will be displayed on the website:
      - Video
      - Pictures
      - Text
      - Links to Youtube, Twitter and Facebook pages.
      - Login Page
      - Register Account
      - Contact us for more information
      - About Us page

 
<h2>PURPOSE OF WEBSITE</h2>
The primary purpose of the site (both in functionality and design) was to create an effective site that essentially for is yoga practitioners of any level to hire one of our certified instructors who best fit you, allowing them to build a program tailored to each individual with the flexibly from training from home.
This site allows these users to learn more about the trainers and their background with the option to contact our team for pricing or any questions they may have. 
We also allows the user to create your own registration or to login in if you already have an account and reviews are also available in the page.

<h4>Mockups</h4>
- Please find attached to my github a mockup file in format balsamiq for the original first design.


<h4>The initial stages</h4>

I've noticed a big rise in demand for online classes as a result of the pandemic situation we're in. After conducting research and gathering material for the website's creation,  that help me to create the page and with the tools and features required for dynamic navigation. Following my plan of action below:


- Map which pages were needed.
- sketch ideas for a "five page" site.
- Write basic ideas of content that would appear and where.
- Established in the final project.
 
<h4>Pictures and Videos added to an images directory in my project repo.</h4> 

I chose to use embedded video and pictures from free stock photo and video pexels website, about people exercising outdoors and with cores that matched the core palette that was used on my site.

<h1>HOW IT WAS BUILT</h1>

- The main framework used to help build the website was Github/Gitpod Workspace.
- Icons used were from Font Awesome. 
- Pictures and Videos from Pexels.
- Fonts from Google Fonts.

<h1>HOW IT WAS TESTED</h1>

<h4>Summary</h4>

- To assist with the quality check, I used Jigsaw and W3C to validate the HTML and CSS during the construction process.
DevTools was also used to test the responsiveness using the device toolbar.
- The devTools style elements and sections to solve coding issues that seemed to affect my page layout when I couldn't figure out what the problem was.
- Another important factor is responsiveness, which I tested by resizing the window each time I added new code. I also put it through its tests by viewing it on a smartphone, tablet, Mac laptop, and Windows desktop.

<h4>What was tested</h4>

- HTML and CSS validation via w3.org.
- External links (to their social media).
- Button sizes so they were responsive and large enough to be clicked.
- Images and text fitting perfetly inside the boxes. 
- Color change and transition when hovering.
- I have checked images to ensure they were responsive and displayed appropriately on smaller screens.
- I tested to see if the buttons were working, but the submit and login buttons do not take you to another page, as this module is focused only in Html and CSS.
- I have checked if the video on the Home page is on loop and working in different devices. 
- Assure there are no grammatical mistakes in the content.
- Adjusted margins and container padding to ensure that content in the container does not appear disproportionate on smaller displays.

                <h1>No distractions</h1>
                <p>When the activity is carried out in a studio, this task is hampered by external 
                factors such as whispers and random movements. In online meditation, however,
                 the center is just you and your mind. Thus, there is greater evolution in the 
                activity and better use of its benefits. </p>

                <h1>Online Meditation</h1>
                <p>The greatest differential of the distance modality lies in the fact that it provides more practicality
                     and convenience to its practitioners. However, in order to be carried out by a greater number of people, 
                     online meditation classes are usually divided into modules, in order to facilitate learning. </p>

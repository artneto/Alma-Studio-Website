            <h3>About Us</h3>

            <p>
                Alma Body and Soul emerged as one in order to complement their classes with deeper content, encourage the personal practice of their students and promote their private lessons. 
                With the growing number of accesses coming from different cities around the world, we decided to open the doors of
               Alma at home to meet the demand and the trust placed in our work of presentation and encouragement to the practice of Yoga.
               We are going through a period of innumerable challenges and suffering as a result of the pandemic. We are afraid and insecure at this moment of great uncertainty.
               The mindfulness practice, often known as mindfulness, urges us to embrace all feelings without judgment. Rather than denying or resisting uncertainty, this meditation encourages you to embrace it. Allowing for our vulnerabilities practicing a little silence and just
               breathing is an act of love and courage, which can nourish and heal us.
